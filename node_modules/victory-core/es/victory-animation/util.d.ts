/**

 *
 * - `null` values get turned into 0.
 * - `undefined`, `function`, and some other value types get turned into NaN.
 * - Boolean types get turned into numbers, which probably will be meaningless
 *   to whatever is consuming them.
 * - It tries to interpolate between identical start and end values, doing
 *   unnecessary calculations that sometimes result in floating point rounding
 *   errors.
 *
 * If only the default interpolators are used, `VictoryAnimation` will happily
 * pass down NaN (and other bad) values as props to the wrapped component.
 * The component will then either use the incorrect values or complain that it
 * was passed props of the incorrect type. This custom interpolator is added
 * using the `d3.interpolators` API, and prevents such cases from happening
 * for most values.
